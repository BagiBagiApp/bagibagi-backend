# BagiBagi: Now Everyone Can Share

## Introduction
Welcome to **BagiBagi**, a mobile-based marketplace that facilitates the exchange and donation of goods to promote sustainable consumption and reduce waste. Inspired by the unique challenges and opportunities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, BagiBagi aims to leverage technology to create a positive impact on waste management and consumer behavior in Indonesia.

## Why BagiBagi should exist?
Indonesia faces significant challenges related to waste management, exacerbated by frequent and impulsive online shopping behaviors. This has led to an accumulation of unused goods, either piling up in homes or being discarded as waste. Key questions we aim to address include:

* Why do waste numbers remain concerning in Indonesia?
* What is the correlation between the pandemic, waste issues, and shopping behavior?
* How far do Indonesian people love to share goods?

Indonesia ranks as the 2nd largest plastic polluter globally, producing approximately 3.2 million tonnes of waste annually (UNEP). Despite this, Indonesians are increasingly comfortable with technology and are known for their generosity (World Giving Index 2023).

## Objective
BagiBagi seeks to create a sustainable future by nurturing harmony between humanity and the environment. Our mobile app provides a platform for users to exchange goods or donate items to those in need, fostering a culture of purposeful consumption and reducing waste.
